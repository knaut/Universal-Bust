# Universal Bust ðŸŒŸðŸŒŒ
An end-to-end Javascript, server-side-rendered (SSR), single-page application (SPA), utilizing React, Redux, & React-Router for client-side applications, and Hapi as the server-side framework for Node.

Webpack does the transpiling & bundling for both server and client-side app.

Designed as a boilerplate project for static web applications.

## Project Goals
* Find a consistent architecture pattern for universal, single-page, end-to-end Javascript applications sans a dynamic backend.

* Render a series of static pages with their own URL. If the application is refreshed on a given route, the server should resupply the application's source code in that state. The application should know its appropriate state client-side and should continue to run as normal.

* Usable as a boilerplate for other projects.
